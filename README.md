# Personal Data Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze daily habits and health metrics of three individuals (myself and two family members) to uncover correlations and patterns. The data is collected using Apple Watch and iPhone devices of each person, and the analysis will provide insights into the relationships between variables such as:
- Daily coffee consumption(cups)
- Daily sleep duration (in hours)
- Exercise duration (in hours)
- Screen time (in hours)
## Motivation
The purpose of this project is to understand how lifestyle habits interact with health indicators. By analyzing this data, I hope to find useful insights that can help improve daily routines and overall well-being.

## Data Source
The data is collected manually from:
- **Apple Watch Health App**
- **iPhone Screen Time Metrics**

Each participant's data is aggregated on a daily basis, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the observations.

## Project Goals
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations between variables.
2. Visualize key findings using data visualization tools.
3. Highlight potential health insights and anomalies in the dataset.
4. Discuss the limitations of the current dataset and suggest areas for future exploration.

## Techniques and Tools
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **GitHub**: To maintain version control and share analysis scripts

## Project Plan
1. Data Collection: Compile and clean data from Apple Watch and iPhone.
2. EDA: Identify correlations between variables such as coffee consumption, sleep hours, and exercise.
3. Visualization: Generate plots to illustrate relationships and trends.
4. Documentation: Maintain a clear record of analysis scripts and findings.



## Future Work
- Expand the dataset to include wider time range.


## Repository Information
This repository will include:
- **Dataset**: Processed data.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Documentation**: Reports and visual summaries of findings.
